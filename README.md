- Obsolete inventory value
- Estimated financial impact (5% yield cost)
- Evolution of obsolescence over time

##  Obsolescence Logic

Obsolescence is classified based on **months since last movement**:

| Category        | Condition               | Label         |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| No Movement     | No stock movement ever    | `No Movement`  |
| Obsolete        | >16 months               | `>16m`         |
| At Risk         | 12‚Äì16 months             | `12‚Äì16m`       |
| Monitor         | 6‚Äì12 months              | `6‚Äì12m`        |
| Active          | ‚â§6 months                | Not shown      |

These thresholds are implemented with DAX calculated columns and flags.

##  Overview

This dashboard delivers a strategic view of inventory health across plants and material types. It highlights:
- Aging of stock based on last movement
- Obsolete inventory value
- Estimated financial impact (5% yield cost)
- Evolution of obsolescence over time

##  Obsolescence Logic

Obsolescence is classified based on **months since last movement**:

| Category        | Condition               | Label         |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| No Movement     | No stock movement ever    | `No Movement`  |
| Obsolete        | >16 months               | `>16m`         |
| At Risk         | 12–16 months             | `12–16m`       |
| Monitor         | 6–12 months              | `6–12m`        |
| Active          | ≤6 months                | Not shown      |

These thresholds are implemented with DAX calculated columns and flags.
